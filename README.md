Open Crowd Source - Home Edition

Description
===========

You have stumbled upon the source code for a simple yet highly addictive party game known as "Open Crowd Source."

The origins of this game lie within the fertile yet dangerous mind of one Dr. Gareth Millward, who suggested it to Frederik Olsen and Troels Pleimert (hosts of the podcast Back Seat Designers) one sweet summer morning.

The idea was to design an adventure game in just 30 minutes from randomly selected cards. Taking the idea and running with it, Frederik programmed a .NET 4.5 application in C# that would randomly select the cards, and also introduce twists along the way to derail the brainstorming. Thus, the Open Crowd Source Machine was born.

The show itself was broadcast live over YouTube with each episode featuring a specially invited guest contestant. You can watch the show over on youtube.com/backseatdesigners.

Seeing as we were having such a good time, we decided to release the source code for a version of the application that would also allow you to play with your own decks. And here you have it: Open Crowd Source - Home Edition.

Technical information
